PSXML PROTOCOL

by David Hinkes

OVERVIEW

This document outlines an over the wire network protocol for interaction
between the psxml servers and clients.

REQUIREMENTS

The psxml protocol shall work over any full-duplex stream-oriented connection.  Some examples include:
 * TCP/IP

PROTOCOL

The protocol is partitioned into virtual packets of the following form:

|  byte 1  |  byte 2  |  byte 3  |  byte 4  |

| psxml_identifier (8 bytes)                |
| payload_size     (4 bytes)                |
| payload          (payload_size bytes)     |
|           ...                             |

The total length of the message is (payload_size+12) bytes.

The packet protocol is a follows:
psxml_identifier = constant stream of bytes identifying the psxml virtual
                   packet.  Always set to "pxsml"000 (byte string  "psxml"
		   with three trailing 0s).
size             = unsigned 4 byte integer which represents the size of
                   the payload
payload          = psxml payload, usually an psxml xml element of size
                   payload_size
