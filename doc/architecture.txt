PSXML ARCHITECTURE

by David Hinkes

OVERVIEW
This document outlines the software architecture implemented by the PSXML
framework.

PSXML is a network based middleware product which harnesses the power of XML
and XPath.  PSXML implements the observer pattern to route messages over
multiple computers.  The messages are user defined in XML form, and can be
subscribed to via XPath.  The PSXML framework is responsible for routing such
messages from producer to consumer via a hub-and-spoke topology.
